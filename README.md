  Howdy, I'm Andrea. I'm an animator turned programmer as of late December 2020. I was goin in and out of programming events and meetups before then but never cemented until now.
  
  I did 2D animation and currently have a certificate of animation, I love working in toonboom, CSP, TVPaint and even traditional paper pencil mediums.
  
  I enjoy exercise and pilates, its been a good stress reliever.
  
  I own a lot of bunny/rabbit motif stuff, so you can pretty much guess what my favorite animal is.
  
  I currently live out in the country, with some horses and chickens :>
  
  I currently know HTML ,CSS ,Javascript ,and i am still learning new languages.
