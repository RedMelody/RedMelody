  Howdy, I'm Andrea. I'm an animator turned programmer as of late December 2020. I was goin in and out of programming events and meetups before then but never cemented until now.
  
  I did 2D animation and currently have a certificate of animation, I love working in toonboom, CSP, TVPaint and even traditional paper pencil mediums.
  
  I am in search of an Email Developer role and learning certifications to help me understand programs such as Pardot and Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
